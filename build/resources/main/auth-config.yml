# You can choose between:
# - h2 -- local storage system of your server
# - MariaDB -- external database (don't forget to define the login credentials!)
#
# If you are hosting a smaller server, like an SMP, we recommend you leave this configuration out.
# Change this setting only if you know what you are doing!

# If a player wants to join the server and inherits this permission, the player will be forced to type in their TOTP from their Google Authenticator app!
# If you want to force every player to use TOTP, just type 'none' or 'false'.

# This setting is for developers who want to implement LunaAuth functions in their own plugins.
# If you set this to 'true', the endpoints of LunaAuth are open for every plugin on the server!
# Be aware that every plugin on the server can obtain the decrypted key used to identify a player.

# The 'open-api-logging' feature is used to trace database accesses.
# This is especially recommended to gather further information about which plugins have access to LunaAuth.
